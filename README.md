# Taguchi-s-L9-method-Black-scholes

The Black Scholes Model (BSM) is an important tool in financial economics in order to measures
the option price at some future date at some defined price. This study is based on the design of
experiment (DOE) on option pricing model at one period. DOE is a set of relations between the
inputs and outputs variables. This study is based on an application of Taguchi orthogonal array
L9, in which the four parameters of BSM for European call option, is varied at three different
levels. The aim of the experiment is to get the more and maximum realistic information regarding
the input and output variables. The four parameters of BSM at one period are; the underlying
asset price 𝑆_0, the strike price 𝐾, the interest rate 𝑟 and the volatility 𝜎. The main aims of this
study are: a) to determine which parameter impacts more or less on European call option at one
period, b) the percentage contribution of each parameter and c) it discusses the section of the
parameters for obtaining the best combination d) and whether the value of a call option follows
a certain distribution.
